                        <p>During this volunteering event, my girlfriend, her family, and I helped booth during the entire event. The event centered on supporting teachers and thanking them for everything they do. There was entertainment, games, and A LOT of food. Our job during the day was to hand out school supplies, such as backpacks, writing utensils, and more, to kids from families with problems affording them. This event was a lot of fun as we all got to connect to the community and serve them in any way we could. The best part about it was seeing the kids light up whenever they realized they were getting new school supplies, and that is something I will never forget.</p>

                        <p>This event was a part of HKN-IEEE honors society. The organization wanted to give back to the community, so after reaching out, we found a nearby antique store that was in dire need of organization. Once we arrived, we immediately got to work. We split into two groups where one group would organize the books and VCR section while the rest of us would be working on organizing the heavier things. After finishing the full day, the sections containing old technology, lamps, and books were completely organized. Allice was much appreciative of our work because since she is on the older side, she would not have been able to do all of this herself. The experience was very enjoyable as I got to bond with some of the people in HKN as well as help out a local business.</p>

                        <h2>Kid's Coding Club</h2>
                        <p>During the Summer, kids usually spend their time aimlessly. The point of this 2 day club was to introduce any child (Ages 11-13) who had even the slightest interesting in pursuing programming. Although the program did not go into much depth about how JavaScript works, there was some nice user interfacing that allowed kids to drag and drop snipbits of code to the respective places. There was also fun interactive activities that were based on coding which allowed kids to associate programming with fun. Without the kids knowing it, they were being introduced into the world of Object Oriented Programming as well as Functional Programming. On the last day of the project, the kids got to watch actual computer programming and see what cool ideas you can make come to life. Although this program was only two days, it was pleasureable to be the bridge that connected some of these kids to programming in hopes that they become apart of the next generation of programmers.</p>
