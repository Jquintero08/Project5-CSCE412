# Personal Webpage
Shown in this repository is the code and images that went into generating my personal webpage. The webpage includes 5 sections (Home, Portfolio, Qualifications, Service, and Gallery). The webpage uses JavaScript to toggle between two different styles except on the last page because it was generated almost entirely using AI.

Many different styles and effects were put into this. You can see these effects in action by hovering over certain objects. Also, download my resume by clicking on the image. You can also access the published website by going to
