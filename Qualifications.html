                                        <p>I have a strong passion for careers in Software Engineering because of the amount of creativity that one can put into it. The limits to what you can design are almost none due to the vast computing power of modern computers. The task of debugging also excites me (although it might not be appealing to most) because debugging is almost like a puzzle. Since I thoroughly enjoy the mystery that comes along with a puzzle, I love being able to incorporate them into my work. Debugging is a relatively easy task if approached with the right demeanor and strategy. Beyond this, Software Engineering has a plethora of career opportunities, including the promise of a high salary, which is good to have when planning to have a future family that is financially stable. </p>

                                        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                                        <p>I am deeply fascinated by the prospect of diving into the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of how transformative it has been on modern life within just the past year alone. As we stand at the forefront of an accelerating wave of technological innovation, one can only contemplate not if but how far Artificial Intelligence will take us over the coming decade. However, with this fast-paced innovation, there also arises a need for ethical vigilance and informed discourse to govern the extent of AI's reach. I have some perspectives on this matter and would love to bring them to the tables of the people currently developing AI to allow for the mitigation of the potential effects AI will have on our society.</p>
